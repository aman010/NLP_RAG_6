The current setup is primarily a retrieval-based approach (RAG – Retrieval-Augmented Generation) that doesn't involve much sentimental or deep contextual knowledge.

    --> Retrieval-Based Model (RAG):
        * Retriever (likely a vector database like FAISS) to search for relevant documents that match the user query.
        * In this case, you're using pre-defined documents where answers are stored. When a question like "What is your age?" is asked, the model retrieves the answer (in this case, "29") from a relevant document based on the query.
        * The DistilBERT model (or any QA model) then simply picks up the relevant predefined response from these documents, without any deeper inference or understanding.

    --> Lack of Sentimental or Deep Knowledge:
        * The system is not learning or making decisions based on the sentiment or context of the conversation. It just finds the matching document and returns the answer.
        * For example, if the document says "I am 29 years old," it will simply extract that as the answer, without any awareness of how the query is framed or the deeper context (such as a nuanced emotional response or detailed analysis).

    --> Static Responses:
        * Sentimental knowledge, in this case, would mean understanding the emotional or deeper context behind the user's question. For example, a question like "Why are you 29?" might require an answer with more contextual understanding (e.g., reflecting on how your age fits into your life experiences).
        * Right now, the response to "What is your age?" is static because it directly retrieves the predefined answer without any deep learning, personalization, or interpretation.

Key Differences from a Sentimental Model:

    --> Sentiment-Aware Models:
        * Would try to understand the mood or tone of the question and provide more emotionally aware or context-sensitive responses.
        * For example, if a user asks "How old are you?" with a certain tone or context suggesting curiosity or empathy, a sentimental model might try to respond more engagingly or thoughtfully.

    --> RAG Models:
        * Focus on retrieving the best answer from a database or corpus of knowledge.
        * No true understanding or deep reasoning is involved in crafting a new, nuanced answer. Instead, it pulls the closest match.

Possible Improvements:

If you're looking for richer answers or more contextual and emotional responses, here are a few options:

    --> Use a Generation-Based Approach:
        * Instead of just retrieving an answer from documents, you could use a text generation model (like GPT-3 or GPT-4) that can generate more context-aware and personalized responses based on the query.
        * This model can take the user's question, along with additional context (like previous conversation history), and produce a more thoughtful response.

    --> Incorporate Sentiment Analysis:
        * You could integrate sentiment analysis models that detect the mood of the user’s questions and tailor the response accordingly. For example, if the user asks "What is your age?" in a casual tone, the response could be simple. But if they ask in a more empathetic tone, the model might respond with additional context.

    --> Contextual or Dynamic Knowledge:
        * If you're aiming for deeper contextual knowledge, you can use memory-based systems (like RAG with memory) that take into account the history of the conversation. For example, if someone asks about your age and then later asks about your life experience, the model could refer back to the age and provide a more personalized response.

    --> Fine-Tune for Sentimental Understanding:
        * Fine-tuning models on emotionally aware data could help, but it requires training data that includes nuanced, sentiment-driven conversations.
